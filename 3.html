    <h2>JavaScript</h2>

    <p>
        JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming 
        language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the 
        client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
